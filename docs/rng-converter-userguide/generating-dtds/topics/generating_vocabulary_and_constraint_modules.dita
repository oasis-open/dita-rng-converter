  <title>Generating Vocabulary and Constraint Modules</title>
  <body>
    <p>You can generate DTD and XSD versions of RNG vocabulary and constraint modules. Vocabulary
      modules define new specializations, either new domains or new topic or map types.</p>
    <p>To generate the DTD and XSD versions of vocabulary modules and constraint modules, you need
      at least one RELAX NG document type shell that includes the modules you want to generate. You
      then apply the generator to this shell, setting the <parmname>generateModules</parmname>
      parameter to
      "true":<codeblock>ant generate-dtd \
  -DdoctypesDir=test/specializations/org.example/1.3/topic \
  -Doutdir=test/specializations/org.example \
  -DgenerateCatalogs=true \
  -DgenerateModules=true</codeblock></p>
    <p>This form of the command will generate the DTD version of the document type shell and also
      generate the DTD versions of any non-OASIS-defined modules referenced by the shell.</p>
    <p>Note that for XSD, generation of constraint modules is imperfect because of the rules for XSD
      constraints. If your constraints are simple it may generate working modules but in many cases
      you will need to modify the generated modules manually to create working XSD constraint
      modules (which is one reason to want to avoid XSD for DITA entirely).</p>
