  <title>Generating DTDs</title>
  <body>
    <p>There are two basic use cases for generating DTDs:<ol id="ol_gd5_1fq_fw">
        <li>Generating just DTD document type shells from RELAX NG document type shells.</li>
        <li>Generating DTD document type shells and DTD vocabulary and constraint modules for
          non-OASIS-provided modules (e.g., your own specializations or constraints).</li>
      </ol></p>
    <p>RELAX NG document type shells are about as easy to create as it's possible for DITA document
      type shells to be. Generating DTDs from them makes it about as easy as it can be to create
      your own DTD document type shells.</p>
    <p>RELAX NG vocabulary and constraint modules are of course more involved but are still easier
      to create and maintain than their DTD or XSD equivalent, simply because RELAX NG is an
      easier-to-use syntax than either DTD or XSD.</p>
    <p>Unless you are a member of the OASIS DITA Technical Committee, you should never have a need
      to generate or regenerate any of the OASIS-provided vocabulary or constraint modules, which
      should never be modified by anyone except members of the Technical Committee (and only then at
      the express direction of the Committee itself).</p>
