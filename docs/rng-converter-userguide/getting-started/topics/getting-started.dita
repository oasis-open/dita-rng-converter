  <title>Getting Started With the DITA RNG Converter</title>
  <body>
    <p>The DITA RELAX NG (RNG) converter generates conforming DITA DTD and, with some limitations,
      XSD grammars from conforming RELAX NG grammars.</p>
    <p>It can do any of the following:<ul
      id="ul_iw2_fkj_gt">
      <li>Generate DTD document type shells from RNG shells.</li>
      <li>Generate DTD vocabulary modules from RNG vocabulary modules</li>
      <li>Generate DTD constraint modules from RNG constraint modules (with some limitations)</li>
      <li>Generate XSD document type shells from RNG shells.</li>
      <li>Generate XSD vocabulary modules from RNG vocabulary modules</li>
      <li>For simple cases, generate XSD constraint modules from RNG constraint modules</li>
      </ul></p>
    <p>Note that there are inherent limitations with XSD that make it impossible, in the general
      case, to generate fully-working XSD grammars. In particular, the way that XSD's redefine
      feature works makes it essentially impossible to generate XSD constraint modules given an RNG
      constraint module. For the OASIS-defined constraints the XSD generation has been hard coded
      but for user-defined constraint modules it will likely be necessary to construct the
      constraints by hand.</p>
    <p>Note also that for DITA 2.x the OASIS Technical Committee has decided to drop XSDs from the
      OASIS-defined grammars. For that reason, and because of the general computational difficulty
      with generating XSD, the RNG converter's support for XSD generation will be limited at best
      and may be removed or modified, for example, to generate from a given RNG document type shell
      a single-file XSD that does not use the XSD redefine feature.</p>
    <p>To use the transformer you need to have RNG document type shells and, if you are converting
      your own specialization or constraint modules, those modules as well. All the module
      references from the shells must be resolvable, presumably because you've packaged them into an
      Open Toolkit plugin that hooks up all the catalogs or have otherwise created a local
      environment where all the references can be resolved using normal XML processing.</p>
    <p>The Ant scripts require that a DITA Open Toolkit installation be available in order to have
      access to the OASIS-defined RELAX NG modules. You should use the latest DITA Open Toolkit
      version available in order to ensure you have the latest RELAX NG files.</p>
    <p>Alternatively, you can get the RELAX NG files from the DITA Technical Committee materials as
      provided through the OASIS Web site. However, the latest Open Toolkit should reflect the
      most-current versions of the OASIS-provided RELAX NG grammars.</p>
    <p>The dita-rng-converter project includes sample RELAX NG document type shells, vocabulary
      modules, and constraint modules in the <filepath>test</filepath> directory. You can use these
      samples to experiment with the RELAX NG converter. All the examples in this document reflect
      the test samples. You should be able to run the commands shown in the various command examples
      yourself.</p>
    <p>Note that longer examples use backslashes ("\") to indicate line continuation for long
      command lines. On Linux and OS X those command examples should work if pasted directly into a
      command window (as long as there are no blank spaces following the "\" characters). On Windows
      you may need to manually create a single line in order to run the command.</p>
