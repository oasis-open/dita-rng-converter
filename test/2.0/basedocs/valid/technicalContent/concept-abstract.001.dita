      <p>Bird songs vary widely among species, from simple songs that are genetically imprinted to complex songs that are learned over a lifetime.</p>
      <example>
        <p>Flycatchers know their songs from birth:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Flycatcher songs are simple sequences of notes.</li>
          <li>Flycatcher songs never vary but are unique to each member of the Flycatcher family.</li>
        </ul>
