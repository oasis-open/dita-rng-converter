      is the common name for members of the <xref href="../../concepts/glossary.xml#genus"
        format="dita">genus</xref>
      <b>Galanthus</b>, a small genus of about 20 species in the family <b>Amaryllidaceae</b>;
      snowdrops are among the first <xref href="../../concepts/glossary.xml#bulb" format="dita"

      winter.</p>

  <p><b>Galanthus nivalis</b> is the best-known and most widespread representative of the genus <b>Galanthus</b>. It is native to
      a large area of Europe, stretching from the Pyrenees in the west, through France and Germany
      to Poland in the north, Italy, Northern Greece and European Turkey. It has been introduced and
      is widely naturalised elsewhere. Although it is often thought of as a British native wild
      flower, or to have been brought to the British Isles by the Romans, it was probably introduced
      around the early sixteenth century.</p>
  <p>All species of <b>Galanthus</b> are <xref href="../../concepts/glossary.xml#perennial"
    format="dita">perennial</xref>, herbaceous plants which grow from bulbs. The flower has no
   petals: it consists of six tepals, the outer three being larger and more convex than the inner
   series. An important feature which helps to distinguish between species (and to help to determine
   the parentage of hybrids) is their "<i>vernation</i>" (the arrangement of the emerging leaves
   relative to each other). This can be "<i>applanate</i>", "<i>supervolute</i>" or
    "<i>explicative</i>". In <i>applanate vernation</i> the two leaf blades are pressed flat to each
   other within the bud and as they emerge; explicative leaves are also pressed flat against each
   other, but the edges of the leaves are folded back or sometimes rolled; in <i>supervolute</i>
   plants one leaf is tightly clasped around the other within the bud and generally remains at the
   point where the leaves emerge from the soil.</p>
