    <title>Pruning</title>

        <context>
            <p><b>Pruning</b> is the
                    process<indexterm>tasks<indexterm>pruning</indexterm></indexterm> of removing
                certain above-ground elements from a plant; in landscaping this process usually
                involves removal of diseased, non-productive, or otherwise unwanted portions from a
                plant. In nature, certain meteorological conditions such as wind, snow or seawater
                mist can conduct a when for natural pruning process. The purpose of anthropomorphic pruning
                is to shape the plant by controlling or directing plant growth, to maintain the
                health of the plant, or to increase the yield or quality of flowers and fruits.</p>
            <p>In general the smaller the wound (smaller the branch that is cut) the less harm to
                the tree. It is therefore typically better to formative prune the tree when juvenile
                than try to cut off large branches on a mature tree.</p>
            <p>Follow these simple steps:</p>

        <steps>
            <step>
                <cmd>Begin by cutting out all the dead branches.</cmd>
            </step>
            <step>
                <cmd>Remove all tangled or crossed over branches. This allows air to circulate and
                    reduces bug and fungi infestation. </cmd>
            </step>
            <step>
                <cmd>Take your time! Work comfortably and do not make shortcuts when cutting stems.
                    Use good quality, sharp tools.</cmd>
            </step>
            <step>
                <cmd>Clean up the area. Burn all pest infested branches. </cmd>
            </step>
